## NFT Portal
A Smart contract in Solidity and a Web3 app to Mint your own NFT collection. Frontend made with React to let users connect their wallets and interact with the NFTs.
The smart contract is verified and live on the Ethereum testnet.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

[Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/) is a popular high-level language for implementing smart contracts which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.


## Optimizations
While improve this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. Allowing users to add their own art works   
   2. Adding a Ethereum faucet to allow the users to mint the NFTs without paying for the gas fees
   3. Transition to mainnet network on Ethereum
              
## Lessons Learned
My learning was focused on using Solidity to create a simple smart contract and implementing it on the Ethereum Blockchain. I learned the basics of Blockchain and NFTs. I combined Solidity with ViteJS library to implement a smart contract which allows the user to creates different NFTs. I learned about spam filtering and how the data lives on the blockchain.

## Prerequisites
    1.Node.js v14+
   
    2.MetaMask browser extension
   
    3.Testnet Ethereum for the gas fees
